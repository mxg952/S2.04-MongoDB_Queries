# MongoDB NYC Restaurants Queries

This project is part of a backend development course using **MongoDB** and **MongoDB Compass**.

## Description

The dataset contains a collection of **Restaurant** documents located in **New York City**. The main goal is to practice and execute different MongoDB queries using this dataset.

## Objectives

- Display all documents in the collection.
- Project specific fields like `restaurant_id`, `name`, `borough`, and `cuisine`.
- Use filters to find restaurants based on location, score, cuisine, and grades.
- Apply operators such as `$gt`, `$lt`, `$regex`, and others.
- Sort results in ascending or descending order.
- Work with arrays and nested fields (e.g. `grades`, `address.coord`).
- Practice conditional queries without using `$and`.

## Tools Used

- **MongoDB**
- **MongoDB Compass**

## How to Use

1. Import the NYC Restaurants dataset into your MongoDB instance.
2. Open MongoDB Compass and connect to your database.
3. Use the provided queries to explore and filter the data.

## Notes

All queries were written and tested using **MongoDB Compass**, making it easy to visualize and refine results.
